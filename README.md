# K-Means-Clustering
Description

As part of a machine learning class I took in my 4th year of undergrad, I was given the opportunity to develop a k-means clustering algorithm and visualize the results in Python. Analysis was based on the seeds data set which consists of three different kinds of wheat: Karma, Rosa and Canadian. In addition to this data, I analyzed clustering on a 2-D and 3-D points data set.

Software

Programmed entirely in Python using only the pandas, numpy and matplotlib libraries. The program implements the general k-means algorithm as shown below:

1. Choose K candidate cluster centers
2. Assign each point to the closest cluster center.
3. Set the new cluster centers as the mean value of all the points in each cluster.
4. Repeat (2) and (3) for any number of iterations or until the cluster assignments no longer change.
